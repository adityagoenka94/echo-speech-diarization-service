        dependence Treatment Center good afternoon everyone at the ABC app games show identity see which is located in ghaziabad we provide a patient as well as Outpatient Treatment and especially with respect
        to Tobacco which is a topic for today supposed to be with you show with respect to the leather installed tobacco and the tobacco use disorders tobacco use has in the past and even currently is
        responsible for causing a greater number of preventable deaths than putting AIDS alcohol abuse homicide-suicide motor vehicle accidents with used to be the cause of the greatest number of deaths this
        is the biggest Event Center what is addiction to the general public as well as even Health Professions we have a different concept of addiction and the dishes not adequately addressed even though they
        had the graduation in the face of negative consequences Sorrento King about addiction many of us tend to come come to addiction with a very realistic and probably has a very strong biological basis
        which I think even dr. So basically we're talking about the one who messes this reward pathway images the music article Olympic party projecting to the nucleus accumbens singer party is one of those
        that we have identified when it comes to nicotine nicotine is a substance that causes a release of a wide variety of this particular. So this is what I was talking about nicotine acting to The acetyl
        carnatic receptors the Dakota cast iron and oven and Gaba neurotransmitters covering areas like the board arousal biological functions like sleep and others moved and anxiety as well as reduction of
        tension message to self esteem by Ben somebody abruptly stop the use of tobacco tobacco products they tend to experience a sensation of depression and raving and go to some more important or one of the
        most perceived side effects of the cessation of using tobacco products most of these symptoms are peaking within the 24 to 48 After quitting and they subside within 4 weeks that completely last year
        but he talked about the Vicious Cycle of drug use what exactly is it that makes a substance abuse has returned to drug use in spite of the stupid one is that the presence of the drug makes you feel
        good the rest of the euphoria that is produced and the other is that the absence of drugs actually makes you feel miserable mental symptoms like anxiety or depression or they could be physiologic or
        the door so this is Alice in a vicious cycle that when you take drugs you would feel good and you avoid not feeling good and when you do not take drugs you feel so high coming to nicotine it might
        surprise many of us to know that nicotine is one of the most addicting substances addiction or let me put it this way addiction as a whole is a chronic relapsing disorder when we see patients coming to
        a clinic multiple times but I'm surprised you're not though it should not be discouraging now that you expected as of course of the disease just as you would expect a diabetic and hypertensive patient
        also are the second point that I'm discussing addiction results in biological changes so if we're still having the concept that it is purely a matter of great it is absolutely not because the Doberman
        party that I was not talking about the previous slide a good movie on using a substance gives you so much that that is behind the theme from using a substance pleasurable activity do I hide that is out
        of proportion to normal daily life the brain is unable to do without it and that is a very simplistic quitting an addiction again becomes not just imagine it is a matter of helping people is a chronic
        disorder Adidas adapts and condition treatment also proteins in two ways show me to go to pharmacotherapy the options that we have to talk about First Line agent so we have the primary aim is that we
        are replacing the lack of nicotine medication or substance use disorders can be used in either individual and individual evidence should we talk about this line line the earlier treatment must be
        prescribed these medicines to the guideline suggested everybody who is attempting to quit a tobacco use disorder should be prescribed pharmacological treatment if we want to rule out or if you want to
        select people to whom we do not want to use integrated a smokeless tobacco to prescribing today solely based on the degree of tobacco show primary I'll be discussing the ones that we have available in
        India becoming upcoming flights transdermal rooms and in Los Angeles using from occur. coming to the gun they have the advantage that they do not have the smoke of the components that has been blessed.
        And he said he's acted Bay of delivering nicotine into your blood so if you talk about what is a metaphor using the gum thing to keep in mind is it is not have a presentation of a tingling or a base is 
        Percy and then it has to be under the sensation basil and this can be repeated and blast you may be continuing for another 12 weeks as being seen to improve quickly if you pretend to store or the
        saliva ejector coming to Patches the standard dose pack is the Constitution that has 21 milligram releasing over 24 hours 1600 super people who tend to have sleep disturbances it might be an option to
        consider the disturbances because of what does back of the batch of NGO side effects of pretty minimal you might have some skin rashes and you keep rotating the site to give me the chance of meditation
        baby come to the Lucent so this has the added benefit that it is not very obviously a nicotine replacement products mistaken for a piece of candy and it is used in a manner similar to the and similarly
        one piece can be used for so why use nicotine replacement therapy in place of cigarettes or how do we use what we tend to do if we tend to set up great date and come the quick date the person to be
        asked to cut out or tobacco products and start using the replacement product then people have to reconsider. what are some contraindications one is gastric ulcer acute cardiovascular condition is
        stable cardiovascular condition to get into the system content equation that has a relative contraindication originally an antidepressant to its actions so the dosage or how we intend to start
        bupropion is 153 days or on an hourly basis and oranges 3 days be invisible 300 so who can use who cannot use bupropion seizures at a specific side effects that you can just take a note up like
        Insomniac right now describe utopian patients at 1 and antagonist stop nicotine from binding to receptors and being a partial Agonist it is cool to have show me the news of dopamine which will mitigate
        the sensation of the draw which comes from an absence of nicotine as I stood out from these 1 2 3 be prescribed in the second week on Route we go up to one milligram CBD and that is a dosage that we
        would have made them for the next 12 side effects most notably most commonly are nausea why this is important is because when you're looking at combination therapy when you combine nrt and a very
        interesting side effect is causing vivid dreams a very erratic behavior and suicidal ideation in uses of varenicline not increased in comparison to the general population so we have to but endocrine
        having the most of the following is not included It generally the method of describing how the idea or banana clip with a short-acting agent which would include gums Los Angeles inhalers raise and
        other methods in our set-up is a preface added gums and Los Angeles are affordable and the that sometimes makes Resort only to the short-acting sweetheart add second line by because they have an
        increased proportional side so when it comes to not appealing it is as efficacious as bupropion when you got it but it has been causing sedation and dry mouth because if the anticholinergic effects
        clonidine again causes Edition as well as hypertension unless you are able to adequately so I acetate who message I would just like to remind you of the options that we have with the Specter
        pharmacological basement bupropion and varenicline in nicotine replacement we have different formulations of and the ideal way of prescribing would be to choose a short-acting this alarm combination
        also that have been combination style of bupropion which direction which is also shown to be more repetitions and either agent because these agents are not indicated we have options like they didn't
        want me to presentation and also covering almost all important aspects of power college going to mention now if anybody has questions please unmute ESL why are over the counter products at 3 in fact of
        what we have on those engines gums and patches Village Inn in two different strengths we have the old enough to let c2225 cigarettes and lighter uses the number of Los Angeles or gum would be according
        to the patient released Bitely between individual and so we should always go by the patient because we don't have the other similar cost the Los Angeles and the gun you just want to come on over memes
        has gone. Hi dr. We can hear you and yeah I would like to ask you like if I place a patient on bupropion and if I lose them to follow up what is the way out for me if I'm unable to track him and he's
        just following his own dosage of bupropion or he said he comes back to me I C I know that fall asleep before we start any medication specially when you're going through something like bupropion and
        varenicline which needs to be prescribed I would say adequate psychoeducation at least tell him that even if he does not take the medication you should not take it without somebody prescribing it to
        him. I don't think there's anything you could do but if he has come back to follow up and he still has important what are the side effects that could be possible that is described in nicotine
        replacement just tell him what is a light wave using the nicotine replacement therapy at the same time 12:00 you suggested it's not harmful to use bupropion and cheese together and inside these have
        been studied for longer periods of time 24 weeks in a year thanks Buena para Parkinson's doctor the project yes or the nicotine replacement as you I mean as you rightly said they're over the counter
        they do not require any prescription but with respect to the other, it requires a prescription and then I'll be by any registered just let me know very important question I would definitely get back to
        you on that Center are in collaboration with the Psychiatry Department how are you coping with that yeah I just wanted to clarify on that he and I do it on a daily basis when I even from the dentist so
        I think with that. It should not be a problem for you you know unless he's at work anybody else wants to share their experience with the pancreatic islet Intervention which they are doing at the center
        the number to Seattle Bible Christian and turkeys are mostly commonly used thank you. Appreciate for sharing your experience can you unmute yourself play some dino Center. if that's a good combination
        follow up on Timmy maintainer weekly professional audio center in Belgium it was a very good session political defense department which department is there any way we can tell them so you did any
        particular drug in that setting I would say the nicotine replacement would be the safest way to go because it is efficacious to order you are not as much as either of these agents without supervision
        would not be advised to if you have a person who is willing to make an attempt on his own for the next two or three months and it takes and 94 to 3 months again he starts relax start smoking or to
        three months in this patient he happy New Year and two months again and again, I beg to differ. collapsing good example for the diabetic medicines are patients of addiction be expecting that they will
        have lapses Journey even if out of 30 days abstinence from nicotine that is going to have a long-term benefit for him so keeping that in mind I said thank you thank you. Just kidding. You have a
        question please go there hello I just wanted to know yet another day by day how many tablets are patient can chew. Genelia safe. Let me see is up to 12 to 18 pieces are depending upon the dosage of the
        formula so you can work out how do you start a gently is V10 to prescribe after 6 to 9 so you can use it as a guy modelo's en prop 2 1/2 an autopsy photos so if I don't know your resident who is Twitch
        you at least 30 days to get the withdrawal symptoms of smoking habits thank you so much thank you like to chew how we actually study like what nicotine replacement does frases we study to have business
        concentrations of codeine metabolites of nicotine nicotine replacement therapy lower levels of serum so when it comes to African see you know that they're not as efficacious I don't think it has been
        explored us 30 as to up to 30 a piece of the day or at least I don't think that has been done so impossible and safety should not be a concern who are you inositol generally the patience of unjust
        tobacco dependence are a rarity and generally what happens is once they've been successfully treated for the other drugs like let's say oh. You don't even see them in a clinic because they don't
        perceive it to be a problem even for the cell and depending upon the stage of treatment for example within the first 2 weeks are going to be a very good predictor of the prognosis So within the first
        month yes man that is a very interesting question so what is being studied I mean in both animal studies as well as inhuman aspect of the dopamine receptor some of these are not even do not even have
        to type the seven years of complete abstinence so what happened to Andrea NW Donovan the biological changes that have something like the backhoe which is the which tends to become associated with every
        daily activities like making up a time or two things smokeless tobacco method is best weather to quit immediately the full always has to be done with the flu along with along with nrt the ideal way of
        doing it is an Abrupt quit so yeah and how to set up court date so gently for bupropion it is one week prior to initiation of Anarchy yeah. men generally advice firstly it also depends upon the
        feasibility of things and how much a patient is willing to follow up so he find a patient to a generally stable so they don't need it done for follow up even if you would advise it live long and suck
        any less like tobacco use disorder anybody willing to follow for long periods of time yeah right now it's time to go for cases the first case will be presented by. On, from CDI games on the screen
        please go ahead Thanks A Latte and a reduced amount of me and he said he's had this complaint of continues to getting treatment from private practice examine he was given a prescription for antibiotics
        and be noticed a questing on inspection was that there was a reduced mouth opening and restricted Adidas white and red patches that were present and the additional requests your focus on the two
        pictures that are on the left as well as the right buccal mucosa and the street that he is unable to produce and we have found that there was there was a presence of drinking when we palpitations and
        the two pictures below and it was a typically of mucus by process and the psychology as well as the intermediate stage of transformation but that was not the other side of the sound does a TPO under
        the decision to conduct an incisional biopsy was Medina of when he reported to the tobacco Counseling Center but I took a history of his tobacco habit do about that video and he's abused and then he
        was going to stop smoking tobacco that is available with the blankie and whitish patches on the mucosa I suspect that because of the line and the placement of a tobacco product into right and left
        buccal mucosa stop smokeless tobacco mouth opening and patient has been put on bupropion because he reported with consumption of tobacco product immediately after waking up and he usually doesn't
        experience a complete pizza company makes do with a non-compliance that he was given to him and also attended so I doubt she has reported again that is the 4th of Jan which is about 16 days after his
        first appointment and it was interesting that he has completely restricted his tobacco habit and he from what he reports on the first day of his appointment and then your sister compare the pictures of
        what it was about two weeks ago to watch it is now that is a slight Improvement in the left and that means you may be under his mouth opening slide into a Christmas through that is fabricated in the
        process and typically placed near the depth are the best to wish he can eat his mouth and try to screw it in and out would depend on what he rest in peace as comfortable and plunging overall dancing
        and the Gentiles appearance in the mucosa has improved Honda one question that I have two apartment leases in the spaces that displays only psychology that was done so how wide is it to stop at the
        stages psychology and not go for the biopsy because this extremely apprehensive. I like if it goes to doctor george mom what do you feel like when did I see the Delta BC signs of recovery in his mouth
        and since I told him today that there is an improvement is a high propensity that he will stop chewing betel nut because he's not only has four that I suppose from his history because he replaces so
        how do we save God such a patient from sleeping a lot more than patient after a bit please episode really interesting case and it brings up the issue of what happens to people when they diagnosed with
        that should be cancerous lesions are cancerous lesions and if so what happens is up to 30% of them relax within the first year to date back to use disorder and I like to order Arkansas under as well as
        opposed to if they have is if they're available but if you're looking at 30% despite having to undergo treatment option to tobacco use disorder I think it would be very important to tell him hazardous
        carcinogenic especially when you're using it until I climb along with it cycle education the first and foremost thing we always Do It Center patient's conceptions right arm is concerned about the risk
        in the right way you tell him that even if he continues to use tobacco the same risk his response to further treatment would probably totally I would say definitely helping with some kind of bee has
        some side effects of the patient is unwilling there's no point in prescribing the drug is going to be non-compliant so anyway affordable she can think of it as an investment for us I had a vacation to
        make it supposed to Saint treatment for a potentially malignant lesion this would probably fall in the psychology and a beautiful name for tobacco counseling and both of these so you know what is the
        motivation can we give each patient so that they don't know because they feel like they are empowered to quit by then Jason don't need any assistance in Hindi I wouldn't say Daddy and address of very
        practical aspect of the disorder like craving so if you tell them see her. Did you find it difficult to me so why don't we we can help you with that aspect of it so you can tell him medicines alone are
        not going to help you as you can you experience experience stress very interesting case and the second case please go ahead and present your case good afternoon everyone today I'm presenting a female

        question to a pathologist if you see my case presentation by Grady was that you're not in such a case where you are inconclusive about even the diagnosis and you know you're unable to say whether it
        is a non-homogeneous leukoplakia up definitely or is it a pouch keratosis as a report of cytology should you also and I can you close at today I presume that there is no necessity of a biopsy what
        station are discussion the pathologist point of view was that what is crepes are very minimal not to contribute in such cases and we have to go per bag is the gold standard dimensions for a 2000 to go
        take a bath with suicidal you would not be here any beneficial dad needs to be charged to normal type of position does an echo spot where there was a case that was family disgust and the dance with

        sound energy into electrical energy and then transferring this energy to the brain and I must tell you about the association that interpretation is diabetic and hypertensive the incidence of a tax

        this song bone conduction and air conduction in this label is indicating that idea and the left graph be black and blue color is within range is normal hearing to 5510 2008 intensity of sound - 10 to
        120 decibels next song okay so when the patient received kanamycin breath and he has some ototoxicity you will have a high frequency in volume so you can see that level has decreased the glasses
        actually going down in the range of 2000 to 8000 frequency diagnosis can be done by using high-frequency audiometry and you can have a date in the high frequency of region in geography and if you see
        the speech frequency which is this is normal slime in normal range in this speech frequency so the patient will not have any hearing loss will be diagnosed only on a high frequency not complain of
        hearing loss but he will mock he might have a lighter so he would say that I am having some ringing sensation or some in the year baby how high to moderate hearing loss in which you can have in volume
        at low speed frequency and at this time the patient would say that I'm hearing Less in what order are simultaneous add is the flatcar audibel hearing loss in which you can see the sequence the
        intensity of the hearing level is down to almost 90 decibels in high-frequency conceited going up 210-220 on hearing loss in which the patient would have almost negligible and these patients cannot be
        treated with high-powered hearing and they might require a copy of garlic Adidas small presentation on my Center might actually endangers the life of Acacia Richmond has to be individualized and the
